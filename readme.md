# Simple PHP Web Application Starter

## Introduction
Welcome to the Simple PHP Web Application Starter! This project is designed to help beginners get a head start in PHP web development. It provides a basic structure for a web application with user authentication, a dashboard, and profile management. Whether you're learning PHP or looking to quickly prototype an idea, this starter kit gives you a solid foundation to build upon.

## Features
- User Registration and Login
- Email Verification
- Password Reset Functionality
- User Dashboard
- Profile Management
- Secure Session Handling
- CSRF Protection
- Basic Rate Limiting

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache or Nginx web server
- Basic understanding of PHP and SQL

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-php-web-app.git
cd simple-php-web-app
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Create a new MySQL database for your project.
2. Import the `schema.sql` file into your database:
   ```
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < schema.sql
   ```

### 3. Configuration
1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`:
   ```
   cp config.example.php config.php
   ```
2. Edit `config.php` and update the database connection details and other settings.

### 4. Web Server Configuration
Configure your web server to serve the application from the project directory. Make sure PHP is properly set up to handle `.php` files.

### 5. Run the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost/simple-php-web-app`).

## Learning and Extending
This starter kit is designed to be a learning tool. Here are some ways to extend and learn from it:

1. Study the code in each file to understand how different features are implemented.
2. Add new features like user roles, admin functionality, or additional dashboard widgets.
3. Improve the UI/UX using CSS and JavaScript.
4. Implement more advanced security features like two-factor authentication.
5. Create a RESTful API to interact with the application data.

## Advanced Features
For developers looking to build more complex applications, this starter kit also includes:

- CSRF protection for enhanced form security
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Custom error handling and logging
- Prepared statements for database queries to prevent SQL injection

## Security Considerations
While this starter kit implements basic security measures, always ensure to:
- Keep PHP and all dependencies up to date
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Regularly audit your code for security vulnerabilities
